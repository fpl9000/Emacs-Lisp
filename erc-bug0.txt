Bug #22099 in the Emacs bug tracking system.

In the latest Emacs sources (Git branch "master"), function
erc-kill-query-buffers fails to protect against being passed nil
for argument PROCESS, which causes all channel buffers on all
servers to be deleted!  This can happen if command /QUIT is issued
in a disconnected server buffer and variable erc-kill-queries-on-quit
is non-nil.

This patch fixes this problem.
